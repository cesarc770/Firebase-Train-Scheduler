# Firebase Train Sheduler

It is self explanatory, you use a form to add a train and when the trian starts working as well as the frequency and the web application calculates when the next train arrives for you.
You can save multiple trains that you want to keep track of. I use front end technology and Firebase to store the Train information.

## Getting Started

First, go to https://cesarc770.github.io/Firebase-Train-Scheduler/
Then, fill out the form to add a train to the schedule

Finally, observe the schedule table where your train will be added
